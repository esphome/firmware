# This firmware is soley for the Espressif ESP32-S3-Box-3 with the Sensor dock.
# It sets up sensors and configuration entities in Home Assistant for the radar and battery in the sensor dock.
# It is designed to be added as a second package to be inserted after the esp32-s3-box-3.yaml package.
#
# Enables the box:
# - to be carried around as a portable VA and have an idea when the battery is about to go out.
# - goes offline and stops listening/streaming when no-one is in the room (the screen is too bright at night).
# - consume much less power when no-one is in the room in order to preserve the battery the VA .
#
# The following are provided:
#
# Sensor:
# battery voltage (hidden)
# battery level (%)
#
# Binary Sensor:
# Presence detect (occupancy)
#
# Number:
# Presence duration (timeout to keep Presence detect true, default 60 seconds)
#
# Switch:
# Mute when absent (turns microphone and backlight off for low power, default OFF)
#
# To use, add the following to your device's yaml:
